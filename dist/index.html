                            Today, I started off with the 100 JavaScript question udemy course and watch some videos on that. I learned about what closure was(got to go back see more about that) the I learn about different ways to zero out a array which arr.length = 0 is probably
                            the easiest way to do so. The I finish on up the videos on node,express and mongodb. I have to go and start a project using what I learned from that course. I think I might read first(clean code) then start on that project.
                            I'm gunna work on some html/css and sass when I'm done with that. I should really keep up with the stats that I wanted to learn and discrete math. I have want to do that haha. I wanna look at some termianl commands and do some
                            python later.

                            So one thing I'm thinking about is what to work on today. So the first thing I always do is look at the 100 interview questions. I started with learning to create an array and then what is the difference of a undefine vs what null. Right now I'm thinking
                            what I should do next. I wanna create something in javascript and the start working on my pet shares website. I still need to create my own person website. I still need to study some more on html/css with the grid and flex
                            system with some sass. I tried gulp yesterday or watch someone do something in it and loading sass on that was much more complex than running it just through npm node-sass. I'm going to read some clean code later. I haven't
                            done much studying on other area that make me feel not to good. I really wanna learn what it means to do machine learning and cyber secrety. With both of the different area of computer science it looks like both of them use
                            python as there main language of choice. I was looking someone resume that got them a interview at the "Big Companies" and im like wow, my resume going to look much better than that so can I just land some those interview to
                            next summer. Will thats all I wanted to say today.

                            What it means to be a white belt is being a constant learner. A mind set of a black black is the same as a white belt in that you have to be a constant learner. Right now the mind set that I have is one of a constant learner. Its hard sometimes. Like
                            I went back to do a small project that I've done in the tutorial plenty times and I still struggle with it. Hard work is and detication is the only way I know that set me on the path that I want to go on. So what i'm going
                            to do keep grinding and the progress bar is going to keep moving forward because there no way its going to move backward if i have anything to say about it. Will today i'm going to pratice some javascript fundalmentals and
                            the move on to some backend and then some frontend html/css and sass and look at some bs4. I still need to learn some python in the progress. 19 year old kid gets a 70000$ job and I starting to believe even more that a college
                            is looking that tasteful.

                            So I haven't been posting as much, but that becaue I to work the grapes right now and I come home after 8 hours in the sun and im tried. I know I should'nt make excuses but you give this job to any other non-hispanic person and they are done by 10am that
                            same day. But what i got to figure out is how i can maximize my studying. I'm figuring out that what I want to be on my resume that i'm a quote on quote expert on is html,cssm bs4, materialize css, js6, react with some backend.
                            That what im gunna figure out.

                            It's been awhile but I'm back. Got my full time job picking and I'm working to code everyday and work out. Sometimes it gets hard, but I know i can do it. As long as i get 30 minute of full on self coding, ill be proud of that, but the goal is still at
                            least 2 hours of coding a day with different languages and maybe even 3 hours.
