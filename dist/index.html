                            Today, I started off with the 100 JavaScript question udemy course and watch some videos on that. I learned about what closure was(got to go back see more about that) the I learn about different ways to zero out a array which arr.length = 0 is probably
                            the easiest way to do so. The I finish on up the videos on node,express and mongodb. I have to go and start a project using what I learned from that course. I think I might read first(clean code) then start on that project.
                            I'm gunna work on some html/css and sass when I'm done with that. I should really keep up with the stats that I wanted to learn and discrete math. I have want to do that haha. I wanna look at some termianl commands and do some
                            python later.

                            So one thing I'm thinking about is what to work on today. So the first thing I always do is look at the 100 interview questions. I started with learning to create an array and then what is the difference of a undefine vs what null. Right now I'm thinking
                            what I should do next. I wanna create something in javascript and the start working on my pet shares website. I still need to create my own person website. I still need to study some more on html/css with the grid and flex
                            system with some sass. I tried gulp yesterday or watch someone do something in it and loading sass on that was much more complex than running it just through npm node-sass. I'm going to read some clean code later. I haven't
                            done much studying on other area that make me feel not to good. I really wanna learn what it means to do machine learning and cyber secrety. With both of the different area of computer science it looks like both of them use
                            python as there main language of choice. I was looking someone resume that got them a interview at the "Big Companies" and im like wow, my resume going to look much better than that so can I just land some those interview to
                            next summer. Will thats all I wanted to say today.

                            I went back to do a small project that I've done in the tutorial plenty times and I still struggle with it. Hard work is and detication is the only way I know that set me on the path that I want to go on. So what i'm going
                            to do keep grinding and the progress bar is going to keep moving forward because there no way its going to move backward if i have anything to say about it. Will today i'm going to pratice some javascript fundalmentals and

                            stuff i was learning. I hated the grades they gave and i hated no learning what i needed to learn and how long it was going to take me to get a degree. So, what i'm going to study today is some javascript and then some node,
                            look at some node and express and some react if i have some time to learn some of that. I know what i have to do to vet my self to some company that i would like to work for.

                            This has been the worst week of coding this whole summer. I plan changing how i do things so this doesn't happen again. I'll be working on a daily and week planner so i can keep my studing on track. The first thing i'm going to study is javascript and
                            read some documentation on that. The some node and my website and lets see where i go from there.

                                I actually have the weekend off and now it's time to code. I have a setup im planning on buying and i think its going to help me code way more than i am coding right now. I can't not wait. So day, im going to code in node, then some javascript and move
                                on to creating a static website for me and then move on to some python and then some react and we will see from there.

                                First on the board is to make a plan to learn how to study. I'm going to study javascript and then do something on my website. Then move on to back and then i'll see were i want to go from there. I really wanna learn some math so i can move into machine
                                learning.

                                Today i get a full day of coding... will im going to do my best and review and the learn today. What i'm really interested in a full stack development and my other interest is machine learning and cyber sercurity. With full stack web dev im going to be
                                a mern stack dev with other languages of course. Like something in php and mysql. With machine learning you need to have a foundation in math. What i know is the the math you need to learn is calculus, statics , probablity,
                                and linear algebra.

                                I thought today was monday. Had a good day. Went to work, didn't really thing about code today which is weird. But i did read the book about code that i took to work today. So if i want to be a software engineer im going to have to code at least 2-4 hours
                                a day. until i start my book camp. The most im trying to learn is the basic concept and some advanced ones. Can't wait till i get my set up and have all them hours to use to learn how to code something very very cool. Will
                                today what ill be studying is some javascript and some node. And i'm going to take a look at some react and some html/css videos.

                                Will today wasn't the best and it won't be my last. But i havent started it yet so there is still time to save the day. I'm going to start off with node and learn about promises and then move onto some patterns in javascript. A little rant... i don't
                                know why but its weird to find that people judge you on the choices you make for your owe life. Like where do you get off to say anything about the choice i make. What have you done that makes you so much better than me.
                                Will thats just something i wanted to get off my chest for the time being. Will one more thing which is funny.
